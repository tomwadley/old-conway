# Conway

Note: This is part of the *"Old stuff I wrote when I was a kid"* series.

## Description

A Conway's Game of Life implementation in VB6 I made for a school science project in 2003 when I was 14.

I've included the explanatory word document (which I've now turned into a PDF for convenience) that I wrote at the time.

Being VB6, you may not be able to get it to run on modern Windows. If you have a Windows XP machine handy or you can be bothered resolving the dependencies you'll be able to check it out. [This](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290887) downloadable from Microsoft might do the trick.
